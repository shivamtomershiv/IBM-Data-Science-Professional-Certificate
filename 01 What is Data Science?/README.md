# What is Data Science
## Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do
**Data science** is a interdisciplinary field that involves employing scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Professionals in data science leverage statistical analysis, machine learning, and data engineering techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable information. The goal is to provide valuable insights that inform decision-making, solve complex problems, and drive innovation across various industries and sectors.

**Data scientists** employ various techniques, including statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization, to analyze complex datasets. Their professional responsibilities encompass designing experiments, cleaning and processing data, building predictive models, and communicating findings to stakeholders. Ultimately, data scientists play a crucial role in leveraging data to drive informed decision-making within organizations.

Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources, and depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways. Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers; sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach.

**The role of a data scientist** involves applying advanced analytical and computational methods to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Professionals in this role design and implement experiments, analyze large volumes of data, build predictive models, and communicate findings to guide strategic decision-making within organizations. They collaborate with cross-functional teams, utilize statistical and machine learning techniques, and often play a crucial role in shaping data-driven strategies to solve business challenges and optimize processes.
