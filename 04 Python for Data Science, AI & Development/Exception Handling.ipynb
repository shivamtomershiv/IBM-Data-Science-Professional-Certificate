The function should handle any potential errors that occur during the calculation. To do this, you can use a try-except block. If any exception arises during the calculation, it should catch the error using the generic exception class `\"Exception\" as \"e\"`. When an exception occurs, the function should display `\"An error occurred during calculation.`\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"411b4e71-1ba2-4589-84e5-845df48401ce","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Type your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"54a8360a-8d8f-492a-9fca-c26423e83524","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["**Note:- Practice handling exceptions by trying different input types like using integers, strings, zero, negative values, or other data types.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c09ebd04-b197-419f-aacf-a369a58325f9","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick here for the hints\u003c/summary\u003e\n","\n","```python\n","Follow these:-\n","* Define a function for the complex calculation and pass any argument.\n","* Use a try-except block for error handling.\n","* Perform the calculation and store the result in \"result.\"\n","* Catch any exceptions using Exception as e.\n","* Display \"An error occurred during calculation.\" when an exception is caught.\n","* take user input\n","* Call the defined function with the user input\n","**Note:- Test with different inputs to validate error handling.**\n","```\n","\n","\u003c/details\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"00551995-96bf-45a7-9505-c3075c125b7c","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003cdetails\u003e\u003csummary\u003eClick here for the solution\u003c/summary\u003e\n","\n","```python\n","def complex_calculation(num):\n","    try:\n","        result = num / (num - 5)\n","        print (f\"Result: {result}\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(\"An error occurred during calculation.\")\n","# Test case\n","user_input = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","complex_calculation(user_input)\n","```\n","\n","\u003c/details\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3134ba19-73cd-4d39-ae06-d248d3a8ec0b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Authors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f708e3d3-581e-429d-9c24-1a7659e9ccb6","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJoseph Santarcangelo\u003c/a\u003e\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"af3034bc-77a3-46d5-906e-afb4a3e1d9ee","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Change Log\n","\n","|  Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |  Version | Changed By  |  Change Description |\n","|---|---|---|---|\n","| 2023-11-02 | 2.2 | Abhishek Gagneja | Updated instructions |\n","| 2023-08-01 | 2.1   | Akansha Yadav | Added optional practice section |\n","| 2020-09-02  | 2.0  | Simran | Template updates to the file|\n","|   |   |   |   |\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## \u003ch3 align=\"center\"\u003e © IBM Corporation 2023.
