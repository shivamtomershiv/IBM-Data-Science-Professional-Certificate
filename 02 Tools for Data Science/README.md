# Tools for Data Science

> [!NOTE]
> Different types and categories of tools that data scientists use and popular examples of each.
> 
> Open Source, Cloud-based, and Commercial options for data science tools.

**Data Management Tools:** include Relational Databases, NoSQL Databases, and Big Data platforms:

* MySQL, and PostgreSQL are examples of Open Source Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), and IBM Db2 and SQL Server are examples of commercial RDBMSes and are also available as Cloud services.
* MongoDB and Apache Cassandra are examples of NoSQL databases.
* Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark are used for Big Data analytics.

**Data Integration and Transformation Tools:** include Apache Airflow and Apache Kafka. 

**Data Visualization Tools:**  include commercial offerings  such as Cognos Analytics, Tableau and PowerBI  and can be used for building dynamic and interactive dashboards. 

**Code Asset Management Tools:** Git is an essential code asset management tool. GitHub is a popular web-based platform for storing and managing source code. Its features make it an ideal tool for collaborative software development, including version control, issue tracking, and project management. 

**Development Environments:** Popular development environments for Data Science include Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio. 

Jupyter Notebooks provides an interactive environment for creating and sharing code, descriptive text, data visualizations, and other computational artifacts in a web-browser based interface.  
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed specifically for working with the R programming language, which is a popular tool for statistical computing and data analysis.

> **Quick Reading**
> 
> * The popular languages are Python, R, SQL, Scala, Java, C++, and Julia.
> 
> * For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
> 
> * Python can also be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
> 
> * Python is open source, and R is free software.
> 
> * R language’s array-oriented syntax makes it easier to translate from math to code for learners with no or minimal programming background.
> 
> * SQL is different from other software development languages because it is a non-procedural language.
> 
> * SQL was designed for managing data in relational databases.
> 
> * If you learn SQL and use it with one database, you can apply your SQL knowledge with many other databases easily.

> * For machine learning, the Scikit-learn library contains tools for statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering, and so on.
> 
> * Large-scale production of deep-learning models use TensorFlow, a low-level framework. 
> 
> * Apache Spark is a general-purpose cluster-computing framework that allows you to process data using compute clusters.
> 
> * An application programming interface (API) allows communication between two pieces of software.
> 
> * API is the part of the library you see while the library contains all the components of the program. 
> 
> * REST APIs allow you to communicate through the internet and take advantage of resources like storage, data, artificially intelligent algorithms, and much more.
> 
> * Open data is fundamental to Data Science.
> 
> * Community Data License Agreement makes it easier to share open data.
> 
> * The IBM Data Asset eXchange (DAX) site contains high-quality open data sets.
> 
> * DAX open data sets include tutorial notebooks that provide basic and advanced walk-throughs for developers.
> 
> * DAX notebooks open in Watson Studio.
> 
> * Machine learning (ML) uses algorithms – also known as “models” – to identify patterns in the data. 
> 
> * Types of ML are Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement. 
> 
> * Supervised learning comprises two types of models, regression and classification.
> 
> * Deep learning refers to a general set of models and techniques that loosely emulate the way the human brain solves a wide range of problems.
> 
> * The Model Asset eXchange is a free, open-source repository for ready-to-use and customizable deep-learning microservices.
> 
> * MAX model-serving microservices are built and distributed on GitHub as open-source Docker images.
> 
> * You can use Red Hat OpenShift, a Kubernetes platform, to automate deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.
> 
> * Ml-exchange.org has multiple predefined models.
>
> * Jupyter Notebooks are used in Data Science for recording experiments and projects.
>
> * Jupyter Lab is compatible with many files and Data Science languages.
